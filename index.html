            A dynamic icon generator.
            Why mess with "images" and "efficient graphical representations" when you can specify custom icons in a simple language to be drawn where they belong on the fly.
        </div>

    <div class="block">
        <div class="content">
            It works like this. Define an icon in the following format:
